I’m an Associate Professor at the University of St.Gallen where
I lead the Programming Group. My reaserch is on programming languages and software engineering:

• Programming models for distributed systems.  
• Reactive applications, (distributed) event processing, functional reactive programming.  
• Self-adaptive software, autonomic computing.  


We are looking for talented students who want to do their PhD in the area of Programming Languages and Software Engineering – See the ‘Open Positions’ section for more details.
