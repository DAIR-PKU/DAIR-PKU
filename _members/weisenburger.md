description: Profile of Dr. Pascal Weisenburger, Postdoctoral Researcher at the Programming Group.
lastname: Weisenburger
publications: 'author^=*Weisenburger'

teaser: >
    My current focus is on the design of languages for distributed systems
    with a wide range of software architectures – e.g., peer-to-peer, cloud, edge, serverless, IoT –
    regarding areas such as sound programming models for the interaction between components,
    their composition, privacy protection issues, placement of data and computation.
