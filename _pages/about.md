Welcome to the Programming Group!
We are located at the [University of St. Gallen (HSG)](https://www.unisg.ch/)
and have a branch at the [Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/). 
Together we enjoy working on **programming languages**
and **software engineering**, including languages and architectures for
**distributed systems**, **reactive programming**, and **secure software systems**.

[Talk to us](mailto:guido.salvaneschi@unisg.ch) or
[join our group]({{ '/open-positions' | relative-path }})
when you are interested in these topics or our work.
Students at HSG or TU Darmstadt,
please find [our courses, theses, and HiWi offerings]({{ '/for-students' | relative-path }}).
